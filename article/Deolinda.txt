Deolinda is an acoustic Portuguese "neofado" group, whose music
often deals with social and political commentary. Founded in 2006,
their first album was released in 2008, which went double platinum. 

Although strongly associated with fado (lit. fate), a usually dark 
and somber form of Portuguese music, they do not play it, at least 
not traditionally. Traditional fado faded during Portugal’s dictatorship 
in the 20th century, but it has made a comeback, by a generation that 
grew up on Pearl Jam and Nirvana, but who also rediscovered the recordings of their 
grandparents’ generation.[5][6] This rediscovery, created a new wave of fado, 
sometimes called neofado, which includes artists such as Mariza, Dulce Pontes 
and Ana Moura, who respect the classics (e.g. the work of Amália Rodrigues), 
but have created their own versions, generally fusing other musical styles 
and/or using electrified instruments.Deolinda’s work also integrates other 
musical styles, including pop, folks and blues, but they do use only acoustic 
instruments.[4][5] Their work is even more distinct in that it is musically more
 whimsical and playful, sometimes called "happy fado" and even when serious, 
 is never brooding. Their lyrics are elliptical and ironic, generally dealing 
 with social interactions and human frailties, often with humor. Their work is an
  indirect form of protest music, which has its roots in the música de intervenção 
  tradition of Portuguese folk musicians, before the 1974 Carnation Revolution,
   which ended five decades of dictatorship. Like their predecessors, 
   their criticism is indirect, using metaphors a lighter pop sound. 
   One of their most popular songs, Parva que sou, has become a kind of 
   anthem for students and young people frustrated with the lack of economic opportunities.
